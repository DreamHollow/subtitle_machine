# Subtitle Machine
A terminal-based program that easily writes out compliant SRT files quickly.

BRANCHES
----------------

There is only one branch to this project because it's a simple file writer.

WHAT IT DOES
------------

Subtitle Machine is a simple python script that can be run on any Python compliant machine.

On any operating system with Python, just use your Python (or Python3) program to execute the script, which will carefully go through the program instructions and generate a relevant SRT (SubRip Subtitle File) for any video requiring captions.


HOW IT WORKS
------------

The program simply takes input from the user, line per line, and generates the lines into a SRT compliant format.

Please keep in mind that at this time, the program does not automatically format these SRT files to exact standards and assumes you know what you are doing.

That is to say incorrect timecodes are not the fault of the application.
